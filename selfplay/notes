- shaping vs currciulum - not well explored by me
- Critic veeery weird
- argmax vs sampling -- not sure, but argmax seems to work better

Next steps:
1. Larger model, now on larger maps too.
2. Half army actions
3/4. RNN vs game theory approach (read FSP,..)
5. Hyperparams and larger scale training

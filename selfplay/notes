- shaping vs currciulum - not well explored by me
- critic sometimes very bad - should I do all-knowing critic?
- argmax vs sampling -- not sure, but argmax seems to work better
- interleave or simultaneous or independent? 


Next steps:
1. Larger model + new features, now on larger maps too.
2. Split actions + gumbel softmax
3/4. RNN vs game theory approach (read FSP,..)
5. Hyperparams and larger scale training

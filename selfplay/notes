Variance Reduction:
- (return/advantage) normalization ?
- one value function that sees everything?
- moving average instead of value function? Or average over minibatch?
- Add KL divergence to loss? -> need to calculate it correctly because of more complex action space

- Reward shaping - is it dangerous or lez go?

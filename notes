QEUSTIONS:
- Value function not yet working (tanh?)
- is50 not working yet, only sending all armies
- postprocessing ?
- CAREFUL WITH ARGMAX AND SAMPLING
- train without its previous actions?

- Checkpoints from later training have bigger winrate but overfit more, what now?

IDEAS:
- Clip large observations
- Add distances from general (also from enemy general ?) as features
- Add channel saying whether I can capture a city or not. This should be learned tho..


WEAKNESSES:

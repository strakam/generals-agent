- Network (architecture, size)
- Learning rate (and optimizer), other hparams, sample weights, class weights
- Features?
- Training only on the best replays - make bigger dataset?
- Value function not yet working (tanh?)
- is50 not working yet, only sending all armies
- smaller dataset with higher quality data better (?)
- postprocessing ?

- CAREFUL WITH ARGMAX AND SAMPLING


- Dev dataset?

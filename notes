- Network (architecture, size)
- Learning rate (and optimizer), other hparams, sample weights, class weights
- Features?
- Training only on the best replays - make bigger dataset?
- Value function not yet working (tanh?)
- is50 not working yet, only sending all armies
- smaller dataset with higher quality data better (?)
- postprocessing ?

- CAREFUL WITH ARGMAX AND SAMPLING

- train without its previous actions?

- Dev dataset?

Replays:
https://bot.generals.io/replays/gV9UZ4Q3p -- I won, tough game. Good location hiding, poor defense at the end.
https://bot.generals.io/replays/0a3f4KhJV -- bot won. didnt know where the enemy was and also underestimated
that he can send so much army at the end, wp. Also good effort by bot to find my base.
https://bot.generals.io/replays/HPLdogxGJ -- bot won vs jonas. Epic defense, when he discovered enemy, went extremely well for the kill. Very suboptimal opening.
https://bot.generals.io/replays/ocMoDl4Ld -- jonas won, bot was unlucky + then fucked up by sending army to city.
https://bot.generals.io/replays/d4MTm24z1 -- bot won, nice location hiding, EPIC BACKDOOR!!!
https://bot.generals.io/replays/bOTYg3ZfY -- bot won, extremely long game, i couldnt find him, got tired in the end and made a mistake.
https://bot.generals.io/replays/kD-AoxK1K -- I won! long game, nice defense from bot but i snowballed!
https://bot.generals.io/replays/L9Drlub3s -- I won! nice pressure but i did surpise attack


Strongest: ...


112: 2 
114: 8
Both ~ 50k

game vs eklipzai https://bot.generals.io/replays/2lWNnfnAW
https://bot.generals.io/replays/yEQGogdnS !!! miracle move fr
https://bot.generals.io/replays/HDtAy3Cm7 lost vs eklipzai, had advantage but didnt defend



TODOS:
- 1. evaluation workflow (checkpoints)
- 4. training run without conditioning on previous actions
- 5. precompile model
